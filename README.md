# Amazon-like E-commerce Project

## Overview
I developed a feature-rich e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to mimic the functionalities of Amazon. The project adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Features
- **Home Page:** Browse and search for products.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to their cart, view a detailed order summary, and delete unwanted items. Prices update in real-time without refreshing the page.
- **Checkout Process:** The checkout process includes order summary, payment details, and delivery options.
- **Size Chart:** Displays size charts for clothing items, helping users choose the right size.
- **Testing with Jasmine:** Unit and integration tests conducted using the [Jasmine framework](https://jasmine.github.io/).
- **Live Delivery Date:** Integrated with the [Day.js library](https://day.js.org/), providing real-time delivery date estimates based on current data.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Interactive UI:** The interface is designed to be user-friendly and engaging.
- **Order Page:** Displays order history and details (frontend only).
- **Tracking Page:** Provides tracking information for orders (frontend only).


## Technical Details
### Frontend
- **HTML & CSS:** Structured and styled the website ensuring accessibility and a modern look.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented dynamic features and interactions.
- **Day.js Library:** Used for calculating and displaying delivery dates.

### Backend Integration
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** The application utilizes modern techniques such as **Promises** and the **Fetch API** for efficient data retrieval, ensuring better readability and error handling. Additionally, traditional **AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)** is employed when necessary to support older browsers or specific requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling techniques to gracefully handle any potential issues, ensuring a seamless user experience

### Testing
- **Jasmine Framework:** Conducted unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
- **Testing Concepts:** Gained experience with flaky tests, mocks, and hooks to improve test accuracy and efficiency.

### OOP Concepts
- **Polymorphism and Inheritance:** Applied these principles to create reusable and extendable code components.
- **Private Properties and Methods:** Ensured encapsulation and data hiding for better code security and integrity.
- **Async Methods:** Managed asynchronous code effectively to enhance performance and user experience.
